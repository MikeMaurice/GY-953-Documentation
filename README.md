# GY-953-Documentation
Version 3.3 of the 2.0 documentation elsewhere on Github.
The version 2.0 doc is hard to read, there are two missing serial commands and the Quaternion numbers are incorrectly documented and consequently unusable. Q numbers and Euler numbers return data types that are confusing.
